# ift6390-kaggle-2 Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data
For  IFT6390 second kaggle competition

### Structure
The folder has follwing three sets of files:
- Data Preperation file (data_prep.ipynb)
- Machine Learning Model


### - Data Preperation Tree: data_prep.ipynb

The data_prep notebook reads the data downloaded from kaggle and performs text processing to prepare it for the model notebooks.  All of the model notebooks utilzed this prepped data that is generated by data_prep.ipynb (train_data_prepped.csv and test_data_prepped.csv)
Some of the filepaths rely on google colab and may have to be changed so that they can be run on another machine

### - Decision Tree: decision_tree_final.ipynb

### - Neural Network: neural_network_final.ipynb

### - Naive Bayes: naive_bayes_final.ipynb

### - svm_string.py

SVM__gamma:0.01

The program takes lot of time to converge and provide with the all the values provided in the code. We only tried these values and since we were able to reach the thresold we did not try other hyperparameters.
