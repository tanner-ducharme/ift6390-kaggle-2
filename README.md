# ift6390-kaggle-2
For  IFT6390 second kaggle competition


The data_prep notebook reads the data downloaded from kaggle and performs text processing to prepare it for the model notebooks
all of the model notebooks utilzed this prepped data that is generated by data_prep.ipynb (train_data_prepped.csv and test_data_prepped.csv)

Some of the filepaths rely on google colab and may have to be changed so that they can be run on another machine

The following files contain the work for our models

Decision Tree: decision_tree_final.ipynb

Neural Network: neural_network_final.ipynb

Naive Bayes: naive_bayes_final.ipynb
